# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
Udacity Nanodegree Data Analysis Project - Term 2  

In this project, I will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task myself. I will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, I will interpret my results in terms of my hypotheses.  

I'll use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, then I'll use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.
